## Pending Tasks

Due to time constraints, I was unable to fully complete the remaining two tasks:  
- **Task 1: Visualizing Activation Maps for CNN-based Emotion Detection**  
- **Task 3: Real-Time Age and Emotion Detection for a Horror Movie Theatre**  

However, I made significant progress in understanding the core concepts and implementation strategies required for these tasks. The experience gained from this internship will help in further refining and completing these tasks in the future.
